# Report_cinic10-source-classifier
This repository contains the files and documentation needed to create or reproduce my report for the Machine Learning Seminar for Physicists at TU Dortmund.

The Machine Learning work itself was done in the [cinic10-source-classifier](https://github.com/AkramAki/cinic10-source-classifier) repository.
